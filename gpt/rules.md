# GPT Rules

This directory contains GPT-only rules. Shared specifications live in `docs/` and should be referenced directly.

## Rule Set
- `docs/` is the source of truth for shared specifications.
- `feedback/FEEDBACK_GPT.md` is the GPT feedback log.
- `gpt/init.md` contains GPT-specific operating rules.
- Do not duplicate `docs/` files into `gpt/`.

## Notes
- `docs/FEEDBACK_CLAUDE.md` remains the Claude feedback log.
