# Feedback and Open Questions (GPT)

## Latest Update
- Updated `docs/feedback-process.md` to require separating latest feedback from previous feedback.

## Previous Updates
- Moved GPT feedback to `feedback/FEEDBACK_GPT.md`.
- Updated `docs/feedback-process.md` to point to the new feedback location.
- Updated `docs/README.md` to reflect the new feedback path.
- Rewrote `docs/roadmap.md` to a parallel workstream roadmap.
- Updated `docs/roadmap.md` to add Phase 0 foundations, dependency notes, and renamed Phase 5 to integration testing + packaging.

## Open Questions
- Ownership per workstream: not adding explicit ownership yet; will add only if conflicts emerge.
- Phase 3 robustness: keeping it as a separate cross-cutting phase for now.

## Notes
- GPT feedback is tracked in `feedback/FEEDBACK_GPT.md`.
